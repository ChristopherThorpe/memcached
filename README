== Features

* clean API
* robust access to all memcached features
* multiple hashing modes, including consistent hashing
* ludicrous speed, including optional non-blocking IO

The <b>memcached</b> library wraps the pure-C libmemcached client via SWIG. Both libraries are very new; use caution.

== Installation

You need {libmemcached 0.13}[http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html]. Other versions of libmemcached are not supported. You also need {memcached itself}[http://www.danga.com/memcached/] if you want to test against a local server.

Download and extract the {libmemcached tarball}[http://download.tangent.org/libmemcached-0.13.tar.gz]. Then for Linux, run:
  ./configure
  make && sudo make install
  
For OS X/MacPorts, run:
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
  make && sudo make install
  
Now install the gem:
  sudo gem install memcached --no-rdoc --no-ri
  
== Usage

Start a local memcached server:
  $ memcached -p 11211 &

Now, in Ruby, require the library and instantiate a Memcached object at a global level:

  require 'memcached'
  $cache = Memcached.new("127.0.0.1:11211")
  
Now you can set things and get things:
 
  value = 'hello'
  $cache.set 'test', value
  $cache.get 'test' #=> "hello"

You can set with an expiration timeout:

  value = 'hello'
  $cache.set 'test', value, 1
  sleep(2)
  $cache.get 'test' #=> raises Memcached::NotFound

You can get multiple values at once:

  value = 'hello'
  $cache.set 'test', value
  $cache.get ['test', 'test2'] #=> ["hello", Memcached::NotFound]
  
You can set a counter and increment it:

  start = 1
  $cache.set 'counter', start, 0, false
  $cache.increment 'counter' #=> 2
  $cache.increment 'counter' #=> 3
  $cache.get('counter', false).to_i #=> 3

You can get some server stats:

  $cache.stats #=> {..., :bytes_written=>[62], :version=>["1.2.4"] ...}
  
Note that the API is not the same as that of <b>Ruby-MemCache</b> or <b>memcache-client</b>. In particular, <tt>nil</tt> is a valid record value. Memcached#get does not return <tt>nil</tt> on failure, rather it raises <b>Memcached::NotFound</b>. This is consistent with the behavior of memcached itself. For example:

  $cache.set 'test', nil
  $cache.get 'test' #=> nil
  $cache.delete 'test'
  $cache.get 'test' #=> raises Memcached::NotFound

A compatibility wrapper for legacy applications is in progress.
  
== Threading

The <b>memcached</b> library is threadsafe, but each thread requires its own Memcached instance. Create a global Memcached, and then call Memcached#clone each time you spawn a thread.

  thread = Thread.new do
    cache = $cache.clone
    # Perform operations on cache, not $cache
    cache.set 'example', 1
    cache.get 'example'
    # ...
  end  

  # Join the thread so that exceptions don't get lost
  thread.join

== Benchmarks

<b>memcached</b> is much, much faster than <b>memcache-client</b>:

You can easily run the benchmarks for yourself. Change to the gem's directory (usually something like <tt>/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/memcached-0.6/</tt>) and run:
  ruby test/benchmark/benchmark.rb
