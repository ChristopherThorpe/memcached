== Features

* clean API
* robust access to all memcached features
* multiple hashing modes, including consistent hashing
* ludicrous speed, including optional non-blocking IO

== Installation

First, you need {libmemcached 0.13}[http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html]. Other versions of libmemcached are not supported.

Extract the tarball[http://download.tangent.org/libmemcached-0.13.tar.gz], then for Linux, run:
  ./configure
  make && sudo make install
  
For OS X/MacPorts, run:
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
  make && sudo make install
  
Now install the gem:
  sudo gem install memcached
  
== Usage

Blah.

Blah.

The gem is threadsafe, but each thread requires its own Memcached instance. Create a global Memcached, and then call Memcached#clone each time you spawn a thread.

Note that the API is not the same as that of memcache-client. In particular, <tt>nil</tt> is a valid record value. Memcached#get does not return <tt>nil</tt> on failure, rather it raises <tt>Memcached::NotFound</tt>. This is consistent with the behavior of memcached itself.

== Benchmarks

Blah.
